## Questify 

Questify is a full stack web application that allows you to manage your tasks and goals. Its backend repository can be found at https://github.com/MichalDziuba/Questify-backend and the application is available at https://questify-md.netlify.app/.

Users can register, log in, and then add quests which can have an assigned completion date, difficulty level, and category. Each quest can also have a description and can be marked as more important (challenge).

The application is built using TypeScript, React, Redux, and Tailwind. It also allows for the editing and deleting of added quests.

If you are looking for a tool to manage your tasks and have a better overview of your goals, Questify is the perfect solution for you! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
## INFORMATION

It's worth noting that the backend for Questify is hosted on a free version of render.com, which means that the server may go to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. If you experience a long wait time or unsuccessful initial launch of the application, it may be necessary to try again to ensure that the server is awake and able to handle requests.
